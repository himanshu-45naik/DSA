# 🧠 DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository!  
This repo contains solutions to problems from:

- 🟢 [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/)
- 🟠 [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
- 🔵 [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

The goal of this repo is to strengthen my understanding of DSA through hands-on problem solving.  
Each topic below includes a list of problems I’ve worked on (coming soon in subfolders or linked files).
